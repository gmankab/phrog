phrog (0.44.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
  * d/patches: update for new upstream release
  * d/control: update build dependencies for current Debian packages.
    Also add some more packages needed only for running tests, now that we
    can re-enable them.
  * d/rules: re-enable build tests.
    Those were previously relying on downstream libphosh-rs features, which
    have now been upstreamed. We can therefore re-enable those, adding the
    corresponding build-dependencies.
  * debian: install new files provided by phrog.
    Upstream now provides a wrapper script making use of `systemd-cat` so we
    can both drop our own wrapper and make our `greetd` config a bit
    simpler.
    Also install the new files found under `data/` such as the `.desktop`
    file and session configurations.
  * debian: acknowledge repacking is no longer needed.
    Upstream no longer ships the problematics files nor do they vendor
    `libphosh-rs` anymore. While at it, update `d/copyright` for the new
    release.
  * d/patches: require bash for wrapper script.
    It isn't POSIX-compliant, potentially leading to runtime problems if the
    default shell doesn't implement the corresponding bashisms.
  * debian: reload systemd on installation/removal.
    Otherwise the systemd config, especially for `greetd.service`, might be
    out-of-sync.
