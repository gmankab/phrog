A greeter that works on mobile devices and also other kinds of computers.
 
ü§ì `phrog` uses [Phosh][] to conduct a [greetd][] conversation.

It is the spiritual successor of [phog][].

## Installation

### Alpine/postmarketOS (edge)

`phrog` is available in the [Alpine community package repository][alpine-pkg].

```sh
apk add greetd-phrog
```

### Debian

Not yet available in official repositories, but [an MR is pending][debian-mr].

### Fedora

Not yet available in official repositories, but [a COPR][copr] is maintained:

```
sudo dnf copr enable samcday/phrog
sudo dnf install phrog
```

### Other

You must build from source, see the Development section below.

## Running

`phrog` is primarily intended to run via [greetd][] - your `/etc/greetd/config.toml` should
look like this:

```
[default_session]
command = "systemd-cat --identifier=phrog phrog"
```

You can also run/test it directly with a faked session, run this from a terminal in your favourite (Wayland) desktop environment:

```
phrog --fake
```

## Development

If your system has `libphosh` packaged and available:

```sh
# Install libphosh:
# Fedora: sudo dnf install -y libphosh-devel
# Alpine (edge): sudo apk add libphosh

# Run üê∏ from source
cargo run -- --fake

# Run üê∏ tests
cargo test
```
