A greeter that works on mobile devices and also other kinds of computers.
 
🤓 `phrog` uses [Phosh][] to conduct a [greetd][] conversation.

It is the spiritual successor of [phog][].

## Usage

### Alpine/postmarketOS

```
sudo apk add greetd-phrog

# Configure greetd to run phrog:
cat <<HERE | sudo tee -a /etc/conf.d/greetd
cfgfile="/etc/phrog/greetd-config.toml"
HERE

rc-update add greetd
```

### Debian

Currently only in [sid][debian-sid-phrog], but you can also get it from the [Phosh nightly repo][phosh-nightly].

```
sudo apt install phrog
sudo systemctl enable greetd
```

### Fedora

```
# Phrog is not available in Fedora's repos
# But an unofficial COPR is provided:
sudo dnf copr enable samcday/phrog
sudo dnf install phrog

sudo systemctl enable phrog
```

### Other

Want to use phrog on another distro? [Please get in touch.](#getting-help)

If you want to run it manually, you'll need to build from source (see below), and then take a look at the existing packaging to understand how to wire up the necessary bits to spawn a functional greeter session under greetd.

## Development

`libphosh` 0.45 is required to build this project.

* Alpine (v3.21+): `sudo apk add libphosh`
* Debian (trixie): `sudo apt install libphosh-0.45-dev`
* Fedora: `sudo dnf install libphosh-devel`

If `libphosh` is not packaged for your distro, you need to build Phosh+libphosh manually. See the [Phosh][] README for more info.

Once `libphosh` is installed, building and running 🐸 should be quite simple:

```sh
# To run phrog without greetd, pass --fake
# You can "login" to any user with the password "0" 
phoc -S -E "cargo run -- --fake"

phoc -S -E "cargo test"
```
